I took a quick trip to Camp Bravo this weekend to work on a couple things and check on the trailer. A pretty bad storm went through a couple weeks ago and I was concerned about damage. We also needed to install some game cameras <!--more--> and put some minerals out in an attempt to attract some deer to the area. Sawyer had a birthday party he really wanted to go to and Ronna ended up taking him so this trip was just me and Tucker. We don't do a lot by ourselves so it was good to hang out with him and run around the woods. We had a pretty eventful weekend all in all. In less than 24 hours we saw two deer and a turkey. I expected to see deer out there but didn't assume we were in a place to see Turkey. I put out some seed for a small food plots so I hope to see some grasses growing in a couple weeks. There's a landowners meeting on Saturday so I hope to take the fam back up there and check cameras and do some relaxing.
Enjoy this short video I put together of my little buddy, Tucker.
