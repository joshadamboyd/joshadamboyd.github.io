It pains me to write this, but we are no longer in Colorado. The weekend before the 4th, we loaded up a brand new Jeep and headed northwest to our favorite place, South Fork Colorado. I traded in my old Jeep and got us a 4 door. It was sad to see the old one go, but I'm loving the extra room in the new one and so does the rest of the family. As usual, we took the kayaks and not enough warm clothes. <!--more--> This trip was pretty typical of our others but I think we also managed to squeeze in a few more activities. It was pretty cold and rainy for the first couple days so we didn't get on the river until probably Tuesday but we eventually got the kayaks wet. We heard the rodeo was in town so we endured some pretty ugly weather to go see that. Sawyer heard there would be "Mutton busting" and we weren't going to leave there until he did that. If you're unfamiliar it's an event where kids ride a sheep and try to hold on like a bronco rider. Let's just say it was pretty funny and he had a blast.

We made our usual trips to visit Creede and we went to Pagosa Springs again, which was interesting. We actually got in the river there too and the boys played in the hot springs. The original plan was to go tubing but I was a little nervous about the river flow this year. With a lot of snowmelt and more rain that normal, the river was moving pretty quick so we opted to just swim instead.

Colorado is definitely my favorite place to vacation (so far) and I don't like sitting around so we tried to do as much as we could in the time we had. We hiked, we payed in the water and the boys spent time riding their bikes near our cabin. It was a great vacation and if I could leave right now to go back I would. Enjoy the pictures!
