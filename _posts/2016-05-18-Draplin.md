A couple months ago I pre-ordered [Draplin's][draplin_dotcom] book "Pretty Much Everything" and it came in yesterday! So stoked on this thing. It's heavy, gorgeous and chock-full-o design greatness. I've said it before and this book reiterates it: Draplin is a ruler! I looked at his list of talks he's given and I was in attendance at his 7th speaking engagement ... <!--more-->back in 2009 here in Dallas. Even then, early in his speaking career he was engaging, funny and insightful. I hope I get to see him speak again. I've only looked at his book quickly, but I plan to dig in this weekend. I love his lists, and his layouts. Everything in the book is well laid out and, of course, that Type! Nice think lines and bold colors abound. I think what separates Draplin from a lot of other designers is his story telling ability. He speaks candidly and openly and tell his life story like you're sitting across from him in a greasy diner having coffee. Basically, Draplin does all the things I want to do. He does great design, he gets to travel and talk about great design, he goes junking, he has his own brand and products. In short, he's my design hero. Even if you don't care about design you could enjoy this book and you should get it.
