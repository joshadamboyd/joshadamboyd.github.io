Dad and I have recently been working on a fort for the kiddos and we made some good progress this weekend. 2 Weeks ago we had just a deck and some walls framed up. Now we have the walls up, the roof framed and we covered and some of the sides with old fence boards. Dad got some old Cypress fence boards of varying dimension from Mississippi and we picked up a planer on Craigslist for next to nothing so we've been running these fence boards through the planer to use as siding. They look like new boards mostly but they'll age in same manner that unfinished fence boards would over time. It sprinkled or rained just a little this morning and it looks like the roof is doing it's job. I'm pretty excited about it.
