I've been working with my buddy David to build a new site. For a while now I've wanted to get away from a CMS like WordPress and go to something faster. So he recommended Jekyll. Now, to create a post I edit a markdown file and push changes through Git and, boom!, I've got a new post. It's going to take some getting used to because I've been using WordPress so long but I think it's going to work out.

Hang in with me and keep watching and I'll keep posting stuff for you to read. I'm hoping to create some videos to put up here as well!
