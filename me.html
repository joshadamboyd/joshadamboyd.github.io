      I’ve done a lot of things since 1980. Some are documented are some not. I suppose these are the highlights.

      I was born in McComb Mississippi and we lived there until I was about five and we moved to Wichita Falls, Texas. I grew up with two Basset hounds, Fred &amp; Lady and I still love those dogs. Growing up was pretty typical I suppose. My brother and I played with legos and mom and dad always nurtured creativity. I’ve been drawing for as long as I remember and, to this day, it’s the one thing I’ve stuck with my whole life. I played soccer in High School and, like a lot of my peers in the 90’s, I dabbled in "Aggressive Inline Skating". I gradutaed High Shchool in ‘98 and moved to Dallas to go to college.

      College sucked. I got a scholarship to study Multimedia at The Art Institute of Dallas and I really had no idea what I was doing. I found a tiny apartment in a crappy neighborhood and got a job across the street from school at Oshman’s Sporting Goods. Up until this point my experience with computers was pretty much limited to playing "Warcraft: Orcs Vs Humans" via a 14.4 modem at my dad’s house. I didn’t even know how to use a dishwasher. So I set about figuring it out. I learned some things I never used again but I learned a lot that I still use every day. Even when I’m not at work I’m playing around on Illustrator. It was during those years that I laid the foundation for my design career. After graduating I landed a gig at a local magazine that was putting a lot of emphasis on it’s web presence. It was a pretty good job but financial woes and the dot com bust took them down and I went with them. Everyone was laid off and I went back to full time at the sporting goods store. This went on for about a year and then one day on my way to work there was a story on the news about planes crashing in New York...

      Fast forward to early 2002 just after September 11th rocked all our worlds and I’m standing on yellow footprints at MCRD San Diego getting yelled at by bald men in funny hats. Over the next seven years I activated three times and went back to school to get another degree, this time in Graphic Design. I took the first job I could get at a telecom company in Dallas before landing a gig as a UX designer at American Airlines. I learned a lot there and eventually left for my current position at projekt202 where I work as a Sr UX Designer on the Southwest Airlines account.
