      I live in McKinney with my wife and two feral children. We have dogs and chickens and a little house and I guess we’re doing alright. Meet the family.

      <span class="family family-sawyer">Sawyer Graham Boyd</span> is five and about to start kindergarten. He loves to draw, he loves music and he thinks doodoo jokes are hilarious.

    <p>
      <span class="family family-tucker">Tucker Gray Boyd</span> is three and already a hot rod. As soon as he’s dextrous and strong enough to attempt a backflip on his bike, he will. He likes to joke and run and has a face that can almost get him out of anything.

      In memory of <span class="family family-hudson">Hudson Oliver Boyd</span>, who was taken from us as soon as he was given. You left a hole that will never be filled and we’ll always wonder what you would have become. Mom &amp; Dad love you.

    <p>
      We crossed paths at a pizza shop in downtown McKinney one night and we had a date later that week. I knew then I would marry her. We definitely did things out of order and that was scary at times but it seems to have all worked out. We bought our first house in 2010 and got married in 2012. She’s the most patient mom that our wild kids could ever want. She legitimately cares about people and likes to do nice things and I’m glad she chose me to keep around.

      Oh, these hounds. Odie is the weird looking one. He’s half Basset Hound and half Blue Heeler. I got him not long after I started dating Ronna in 2009 so he’s like our first kid. He’s a crazy little mutt that exhibits the characteristics of both of his breeds. When he’s not lounging, he chases the kids around the yard and acts like a heeler. He thinks he owns the couch.

      Ruby is our Redbone Coonhound we got in 2012. She’s loud, clumsy, hungry and obnoxious but she’s the sweetest dog ever. She loves to be with her people and she would run all day if we had more room.
