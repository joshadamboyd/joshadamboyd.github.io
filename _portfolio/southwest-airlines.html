  I consider American to be my first real job after college. It was my first job in UX for sure. Prior to that I worked for a small telecom company as an all around designer and the work I did there was all over the place. Once I landed the gig at American I began to hone in on my craft. I was assigned to various projects while employed there and worked on everything from homepage concepts during the rebrand to booking path products as well as some work on internal apps. This was my first foray into Agile as a software methodology and it was certainly foreign to me but it was definitely a learning experience.

  This was one of my biggest projects at American Airlines and I’m proud of how the first release turned out. The goal was to encourage customers to book flights using their miles weather they know where they want to go or not. For the first release the user can search available destinations based on a number of criteria including date, type of destination, and how many miles to use. The results show what destinations are available based on their criteria and also show destinations within 12.5k miles, allowing the user to buy miles in order to choose a destination that might otherwise be out of reach. In the future we would like to include features such as flexible dates and Frommer’s data as well.
